Whenever a file in the requirement/ folder is modified or a code-change request is issued from the terminal, finish the code fix first and then always verify whether the corresponding design document in the spec/ folder needs to be updated.
If an update is required, apply it.
If the design document should exist but does not yet, create a new file in spec/ and then update it accordingly.

The files inside the requirement/ folder contain business and functional requirements. Whenever those files change, review all test code to ensure that scenarios and use-cases still satisfy the updated requirements, and revise the tests if necessary.

After every code modification, run the test suite.

If any test fails, continue fixing the code until all tests pass.
